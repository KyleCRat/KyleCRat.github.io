  <h1>The Technology Stack: Ruby on Rails</h1>
  <img src="img/Logo_DarkCyan.svg" alt="KRLogo" class="logo">
  <p>I have spent the past few months wrapping my head around the basics of Ruby on Rails. Following railstutorial.org by Michael Hartl and taking a Ruby on Rails class here at Michigan State University all while slowly rebuilding a personal website. At first this framework seemed like pure magic with only a couple files and minimal lines of code things started appearing on my screen. Things that took me hours to understand even the basics of when using PHP. </p>
  <p>In an attempt to understand this “magic” I took a look into the Ruby on Rails stack. A “stack” as I understand it, is the combination of multiple technologies that when put together are able to achieve a goal from start to finish. There are many examples of stacks such as LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP), LEMP (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP), or countless others. However when I started looking into the Rails stack, my searches weren’t returning with quite what I expected. </p>
  <p>The Ruby on Rails default stack for a brand new developer will most likely be, as stated in Daniel Kehoe’s “What is Ruby on Rails?”: A operating system (windows, OSX, linux), Ruby on Rails (Rails web framework and ruby programming language), WEBrick web server (included with ruby), and a SQlite database. Here, even at the most basic stack with Rails you already have choices abet not many. But even the seasoned veterans of the Rails framework apparently haven’t quite decided on a default stack for Ruby on Rails. In the blog “Rails has Two Default Stacks” by Steve Klabnik he speaks of two stacks for Rails: the “Omakase Stack” and the “Prime Stack”. The Omakase Stack, named by him due to the “Rails is Omakase” principle behind Rails, is the default stack provided by Ruby on Rails.  And the “Prime Stack”, which is more of an idealized stack that can vary slightly depending on the person, but this stack encompasses the idea there is a large group of Rails developers that view the default stack as something other than the Omakase Stack. </p>
  <p>Okay, so Ruby on Rails does not have a widely accepted default stack, so what? Well as talked about by Steve Klabnik in his same article, this makes things difficult on a beginner Rails developer. If you’re like me, learning ruby for the first time and then on top of that learning rails with ruby. There already seems to be a mountain in front of you that is daunting, even if the payout is fantastic DRY pages with rapid prototyping on a wonderful framework with nearly a decade of development. When adding in a second default stack beginners are now tasked with learning the many other technologies that the other stack uses, when they don’t even have the understanding of why these technologies are better than the defaults. </p>
  <p>It is hard to not feel somewhat discouraged when reading articles like this as a newcomer to a nearly decade old technology. Although it is a lot, it also means there are innumerous amount of options, technologies, and developers dedicated to seeing Ruby on Rails be the best it can be. So researching the stack of technologies behind Rails may not do much to enlighten oneself on the exact magic that happens within this framework, but maybe accepting the magic as a newcomer and letting ourselves use future experience to learn why things work the way they do isn’t the end of the world. I myself look forward to making my mistakes with Rails in whichever form its stack comes, then learning and becoming a better developer because of it.</p>
